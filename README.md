## Contents

This repository contains code that we created during Programming Level 1/2 in Grade 10.

Most of the code is in Swift and the main framework that we used in the class is SwiftUI.

This also contains the app that I developed. You can find it in **Hab.it** folder.

My slide deck is also included, which I pitched during the *Final Showcase* in June 2025.

## Context

During the semester, I learned how to communicate in Swift. I didn't know very much about Swift at first. Throughout the term, I learned how to put together a really cool wireframe in Keynote. Then, I took a chance and learned how to translate those ideas from Keynote into an actual app using Swift.
